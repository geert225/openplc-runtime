"""
Mutex Manager for OpenPLC Python Plugin System

This module provides centralized lock management for thread-safe buffer reads.
It wraps the runtime's flush-on-lock image API: acquire() takes the image mutex
and drains the journal (so reads see freshly committed values), release() frees
it. Buffer WRITES do not use this lock -- they go through journal_write_*.

The public method names (acquire / release / with_mutex) are unchanged so the
plugin-facing BufferAccessor stays source-compatible; only the underlying lock
moved from the retired buffer_mutex to image_lock()/image_unlock().
